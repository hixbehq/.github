## Contributing to Hixbe Limited

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hixbe! We welcome contributions from anyone — whether it's a bug report, documentation improvement, or code change.

Please follow these guidelines to make the process smooth and fast:

### Get started
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- For bug reports, include a clear description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.

### Pull request process
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch named like `fix/short-description` or `feat/short-description`.
- Keep changes focused and atomic. One feature or fix per PR helps reviewers.
- Run the test suite and linters before submitting a PR. Update or add tests where appropriate.
- Open a PR against `main` and fill out the PR template (if present) with the motivation and implementation details.

### Code style
- Follow existing project conventions. Keep formatting consistent—run any provided formatting tools (e.g., `prettier`, `black`).
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Start commit titles with `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, or `refactor:` where appropriate.

### Reviews
- Assign reviewers or request review from code owners as indicated in `CODEOWNERS`.
- Address feedback promptly. Keep PRs up-to-date by rebasing or merging the target branch as needed.

### Tests
- Add unit or integration tests for new behavior and to reproduce bugs when fixing them.
- CI should pass before merging. If a change impacts build or CI workflows, explain how it was validated.

### Security
- For security issues, please do not open a public issue. Contact the maintainers privately at `hello@hixbe.example` (replace with an actual address) or follow any published security policy.

Thanks again — contributions help make Hixbe better for everyone.
